# 💻 For Developers

The application is entirely built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a cross-platform UI toolkit for building applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to run the app
5. Run `flutter test` to run the tests
6. Run `flutter build apk` to build the apk

```

## 🖼️ Presentation

The **user interface** is in `lib/features`. Each feature is contained in its own directory and consists of screen(s) and/or widgets. The UI layer is responsible for communicating with the business logic layer.

_note: not all the logic and UI is completely separated_

## 📱 Business logic

The **business logic** is also contained in `lib/features`. When state management becomes complex, we switch to blocs (using the [Business Logic Component pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/)). Complex features consist of a `bloc` and `event` and `state` classes. The `bloc` class contains the business logic and the `event` and `state` classes are used to communicate with the `bloc`. The `bloc` class is also responsible for communicating with the data layer through the repositories.

## 📝 Models

**Models** are in `lib/common/models`. This folder contains the data models used throughout the app. Currently there is only one model, `Score`, which represents a score.

## 📦 Data

**Data** is handled in `lib/common/data`. This folder contains the logic for fetching and storing data. The repositories are responsible for communicating with the data sources. The data sources are responsible for fetching and storing data from the respective sources: local database with the Flutter SQLite plugin [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) and local filestorage with `dart:io` and [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider).

## 🧪 Testing

**Tests** are in `test`. Currently, there are only unit tests that test the models and datasources. The tests are run using the [Flutter test](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing) framework.

## 🙂 Facial Gesture Tracking
The gesture tracking leverages ML Kit's face detection API for precise landmarking and rotational information. When the user's head rotation surpasses a predefined threshold, the app flips to the next page. The app waits for the user's head to return below the threshold to reset the process.
